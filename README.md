# SharePoint utility scripts, fixes and tweeks

This repository contains small utility script, fixes and tweeks that we are collecting while working with SharePoint 2016. 

If you have some of your own just send it to us and we can place it here. Perhaps one day Microsoft will use them to fix their product. :-)
